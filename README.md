# ZipDict
ZipDict is a tool for unpacking password protected Zip file entries where passwords are from a known list of strings.

**NOTE: Zipdict is provided for the purposes of Unlocking content you have legally purchased for the purpoise of spaceshifting and archiving.  It is illegal to crack materials you have not bought or for the purposes of redistribution to others that have not bought said material.**

I wrote ZipDict in order to spaceshift locked FantasyGrounds content.  As such it comes with a string list called FGStrings.txt that contains all passwords to try.  To unlock other content you will need to repalce it with your own strings list.  You can retrieve a list of candidate strings from a Windows program by using CheatEngine or another in memory debugger.

To use, put all the zips you wish to unlock in a folder.  
Set the folder in the interface.  
Set an output folder for the unpacked files in the interface
Press the CRACK  button.

You can monitor the files that have been unlocked and the password used to unlock them in the console output.
